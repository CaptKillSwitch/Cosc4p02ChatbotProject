GOLD MEDALLIST AT THE 2018 BRAMPTON CUP","My Dad, Gil Balteiro who is a former 3x Canadian Boxing Champion and Bronze Medallist at the 1990 World Junior Boxing Championships in Istanbul, Turkey. And my Uncle Alex Balteiro former Canadian Boxing Champion","The reason I started boxing was because I had been inspired by my dad at a young age. Every young kid wants to be just like their dad when they grow up, and I was fortunate enough to have a father that was a great boxer, holding an 86-6 record as an amateur and even receiving Bronze at the 1994 Junior World Boxing Championship in Istanbul, Turkey. Although I started boxing only 2 years ago, throwing punches was nothing new to me. I had been training in my garage every once in a while since I was 9. My dad introduced me to the boxing world by handing me over to his former coach, Doug Patterson. August of 2017 was when I finally had my first fight, I wasn’t familiar with the word composure, leading me to my first loss as a fighter. After learning from my mistakes, I had the chance to compete in the Ontario Silver Gloves where I beat my first opponent by unanimous decision, and receiving the chance to rematch my first ever opponent. Giving my tough opponent 2 eight-counts in rounds 1 and 3 lead me to another unanimous victory. After winning the Silver Gloves it was back in the office and looking ahead toward the next tournament, Golden Gloves. Golden Gloves was my chance to get some provincial exposure, knowing there had been no one in my weight division in the open category I always had hope that the Ontario team would take me into consideration. I fought a great fight and ended up victorious again. Acknowledging that Ontario Winter Games was only 2 months away I trained hard. When I went to the OWG I had to fight an open youth fighter to prove that I was capable of competing at the Super Channel Nationals in Edmonton. After winning another unanimous decision I had finally displayed composure and a high skill level, leading me to my first nationals. I went to Nationals with only 6 fights and fought 1 tough fight against an opponent from Newfoundland. I won another unanimous decision making me 2018’s Junior C National Champion in the Light Heavyweight division. After nationals my coach set up a fight against USA’s National Champion, although he had over 60 fights I stuck right with him the whole 3 rounds. In the end I received my second loss by split decision. After experiencing a fight against a high level fighter I knew what was expected internationally. I trained hard throughout the summer working on my strength and conditioning, but didn’t get a chance to find a fight. The next step for me was this year’s Golden Gloves where I won another unanimous decision against an older, more experienced fighter which now has lead me here at the Canada Winter Games. I am very excited and honored to be competing in the biggest Winter sporting event across the nation. I could not have done any of this without the help and support of my family, Coach Doug Patterson, Fighting Island Boxing Club, and all my local fans. I am truly blessed to have such an amazing support team through it all.",,0,1,0,1

Being that it is set up like a mini Olympic event I think it will be amazing to meet people from other provinces both in my sport and in other sports. I have such a passion for sport and it will be awesome to meet others with a similar passion. My overall snowboard goal is to put down the best run I can on the course. Competition will be stiff but we have a comraderie in Slopestyle and we support each other, encouraging each other to do our best.","Results are all in perspective and progression and experience is key, but coming 1st at the Canadian Air Nation Sun Peaks Slopestyle stop last year was pretty cool. Everyone rode so well so it was up in the air to the placements. One of my teammate's was recording my reaction without me knowing it. I was completely surprised and ecstatic. After my 2018 season I earned my way to the Junior World Snowboard Championships in Cardrona, New Zealand. This was an amazing experience and placing 19th at the Junior World Snowboard Championships was quite an accomplishment for me. Last year's (2018) work and results placed me at 9th in Men's Slopestyle in Canada and 54 in the World. These are my best results so far!","I have earned awards and honours in Snowboarding, Wakeboarding, and Dance. In snowboarding I was named to the NextGen Slopestyle team for 2019. This has been amazing - with opportunities to travel and compete nationally and internationally. It is an honour to be part of this team as well as my home team - The Senders. I also participate in competitive wake boarding. Most recently I participated in the Wake Park World Championships this past Fall where I came first in my age division. I was also an honour student in my first year of high school and have been recognized for community involvement at various times.","I admire many riders from many places as they all have things to offer and teach me by watching them and in some cases meeting them. Of course our Canadian National team - Mikey, Tyler, Mark, Seb, Max, Darcy, Spencer, Laurie, Brooke, are all talented and admirable. I really, really admire Mikey Ciccarelli He has amazing style and is a great, great rider. He grew up in Ontario, riding the same parks, and started on the same team (not at the same time) with some of the same coaches as me. I can relate to Mikey. We both lost of dad's (and therefore a big part of our support systems) to cancer as we were/are progressing in snowboarding. Watching him and his career- I feel like I can do it, no matter the obstacle. Someone once told me - When life throws you obstacles, bring your board.","As a child I was very active. My family spent time outdoors in all seasons. We canoed, hiked, camped, snowshoed - lots of different activities. I gravitated to sport that was a bit more high risk from an early age and my parents figured they should at least let me learn some skills 'cause I was going to do it anyway! I happened to meet a Senders coach when I was 8 and was presented with the opportunity to train with The Senders from that early age. From day 1 I have been dedicated and so has my family. It gives me an outlet for creativity, energy, and competition. Sport is a passion for me. I can't imagine what I would be doing without sport!",,0,1,0,1

- 2016 school humanitarian of the year","I can’t narrow down my role model to one person as there are 3 people in my family that are my role models. My dad has thought me many life lessons and has taught me a lot about staying steady with my emotions and helping my learn how to battle through adversity. He has taught me a lot about hockey and I am the player I am today because of him. My mom has taught me a lot of stuff away from the rink. She is a child care worker and my old school in Abbotsford so she has a lot of knowledge about lessons that are far away from the rink. She consistently checks up on me to see how I’m doing, loves watching me play hockey and she’s always the best mom that I could ever ask for. Then there’s my brother who is always there to challenge me and make me a better competitor. As I was growing up he never let me off easy and always pushed me whenever we were doing anything, from who got to drink out of what colour glass when we were very little, to wrestling and playing mini sticks, Thomas always taught me to work hard in life and never stop until you succeed.","When I was 2-3 years old all that I ever dreamed of was playing hockey. Every Canuck game that was on I would be watching with a mini-stick in hand and a Canuck jersey on. I loved everything about the game, and that love has only got stronger as the years have gone on.

Later on, my mother skated with me really fast with an on-ice skate aid and I loved the feeling of “flying” on ice. Soon I learned how to skate by myself with a chair during outdoor public skating. Mom convinced me to take skating lessons because she couldn’t teach me how to stop properly on ice. That was how I started skating. Now I really enjoy figure skating.

Student of the class award
Honesty award","My personal role model is terry fox, forever and ever!","I started out as a competitive gymnast and absolutely hated every minute of every practice. Practices were so long. One day I started crying in the middle of my beam routine, Forcing my mom to remove me to settle me down. I told her how much I hated the sport. She finally agreed to let me stop attending practices.I participated in fitness lessons and outdoor activities to keep my fitness up until I found something to do. My mom brought me to the squash facility where I got to watch the top players in the world. I remember thinking how cool it was for so many people to be watching them and asking for pictures after their practices. So I told my mom to put me. The first couple of lesson weren’t very good, it just made me think a different way of the sport. I wasn’t able to grasp on any skill because my body was so tense from gymnastics. Until the summer of 2013. My family moved to canada, hoping to build a foundation for my brother and I, and to wider opportunity ranges. I joined the beginner class for 3 years until I was 11. I told my mom that I wasn’t being challenged at all and that I wanted to move to the more advanced group where my older brother trains. She talked to my coach, Jonathan hill and he agreed to put me in. I was the youngest and most unexperienced, but that only made me work harder. So, as you can see I started playing competitive squash at 11, ever since joining the group, have supportive teammates, amazing parents, and the best coach, it gave me opportunities to travel around the world and compete under Canada, and now I cannot believe I’m apart of the Canada winter games squash team. It’s such an honour being able to make a team for a big event. I worked my butt off for hours and hours a day to make it to where I’m today. I also have to give credit to my brother for always pushing me and telling me that anything is possible.",,0,0,1,1

J’espère pouvoir relever ce défi. Mon deuxième but est de bien me battre, et de gagner de l’expérience. Je souhaite être satisfaite de mes performances. À la fin de la journée, ce n’est pas la médaille qui compte, mais le fait d’avoir participé et d’être satisfaite de mes combats.","Mon record personnel est la compétition qualificative pour les jeux du Canada, plusieurs mois avant la compétition. J’ai été informée par mon coach Hugues Tremblay que cette année j’allais avoir la possibilité de me qualifier pour les Jeux du Canada. J’ai tout de suite sauté sur l’opportunité qui m’avait été donnée. Ma préparation mentale allait être critique pour cette compétition car, je connaissais très bien mon adversaire et je ne l’avais jamais battue auparavant. Je me suis fixé un but. Je voulais vraiment participer aux Jeux et finalement gagner contre mon adversaire. Quelques semaines après avoir commencé ma préparation physique et mentale, j’ai appris que Judo Québec amenait l’équipe du Québec des jeux du Canada en France pour un tournoi et un camp d’entraînement préparatoire avant les Jeux du Canada. Ma motivation pour gagner la qualification a tellement augmenté, je n’ai jamais été aussi motivée d’atteindre un but fixe. Je pensais seulement à la compétition (de qualification) à Québec. Je parlais du voyage en France et des jeux chaque jour. Je me suis mise beaucoup trop de pression et cela a paru. Une semaine avant la compétition, j’ai commencé a vraiment ressentir le stress, je le savais que je ne pouvais pas avoir de doute rendue sur les tapis et qu’il fallait que je reste concentrée pour atteindre mon but. Malgré toute ma préparation, un soir, après un entraînement de judo j’ai cassé sous la pression que je mettais sur moi-même. J’ai ressenti la fatigue et l’épuisement physique et mental de tous les entraînements qui étaient supposément ma préparation pour Québec, mais à ce moment précis cela me détruisait. Heureusement ma mère et mon père ont été à côté de moi pour m’aider à passer au travers. Rendue à la compétition, j’ai pu avoir le bon état d'esprit. On pouvait ressentir le stress dans l’air au site de la compétition. Je n’étais pas la seule à vouloir faire les Jeux. Je n’ai jamais été aussi concentrée pour un combat de ma vie. J’avais un but et c’était de me battre pour moi-même et de me prouver que j’étais capable d’atteindre mes buts, si je le voulais. J’ai gagné mes deux combats et mon adversaire a refusé le combat de barrage, donc j’étais automatiquement qualifiée pour les Jeux du Canada et le tournoi de préparation en France. Cette compétition m’a extrêmement marquée. Je sais maintenant qu’il est important d’être prête pas seulement physiquement, mais aussi mentalement.","Prix élite Côte-Nord JUDO URLS 2018

2017-2018","Mon inspiration c’est mon frère: Jérémie Lapointe. Lui aussi, il est un judoka. Il a toujours travaillé fort pour atteindre ses buts, tout en trouvant du temps pour être avec sa famille et ses amis. Il est aussi très déterminé et quand il veut quelque chose, il n’a pas peur de mettre le travail nécessaire. Jérémie c’est mon modèle parce que c’est mon frère et même si parfois je suis dans son ombre, il m’aide beaucoup à m’améliorer et il me motive à continuer à travailler fort.","J’ai été introduite au sport par mon frère Jérémie. Je me souviens très bien du jour où j’ai décidé d’essayer le judo. Mon frère participait à une compétition régionale à Port-Cartier. Donc, je suis allée l’encourager. Ce sport a tout de suite piqué ma curiosité. La saison suivante, j’étais sur les tapis prête à apprendre le judo. J’ai adoré ce sport, je pouvais bouger et dépenser de l’énergie. Ma mère n’était pas certaine que j’allais aimer la compétition, mais j’ai aimé cela. Un an après avoir commencé le judo, j’ai été diagnostiquée avec une maladie nommée le lupus. Le lupus est une maladie du système immunitaire et si ce n’est pas bien contrôlé, cela cause beaucoup de la douleur articulaire et de la fatigue chronique. Après mon diagnostique, mes médecines m’ont dit que je ne pouvais plus faire de judo, ni d’activité physique. J’ai tout de suite regardé ma mère pour lui dire qu’il n’était pas question que j’arrête le judo. Je venais de commencer à compétitionner. J’aimais beaucoup trop cela, je ne pouvais pas me faire à l’idée de quitter ce sport. Cela a été un long processus de trouver la bonne médication et les bonnes techniques pour gérer ma maladie. Aujourd’hui, heureusement ma maladie est bien contrôlée, mais il arrive que parfois la douleur revienne et que je sois extrêmement fatiguée. Cette maladie arrive par crise. Je peux être bien pour deux semaines et après être trop épuisée pour aller faire des entraînements et même aller à l’école. Je ne vais pas laisser la maladie m’empêcher de faire les choses que j’aime, même si parfois c’est difficile.",,0,0,2,2
